					Under <b>Tuning</b>, we can tune the model to our preferred tradeoff
					between precision and recall. Since we would like to reduce false
					negatives, we want to increase recall.
				</ui.P>
				<ui.Callout level={ui.Level.Info} title="Precision and Recall">
					Precision is the proportion of our model's positive predictions whose
					true value is actually positive. If your model is an email spam
					detector, you probably want high precision to minimize false
					positives: It is better to let a few spam emails into your inbox than
					to send an important email to the junk folder. Recall is the
					proportion of examples whose true value is positive that we predicted
					were positive. If your model is a credit card fraud detector, you
					probably want high recall to minimize false negatives: It is better to
					accidentally flag a few legitimate transactions than to let fraud
					through.
				</ui.Callout>
				<ui.P>
					Using the slider, we can select a threshold that lowers false
					negatives without increasing false positives too much. As we drag the
					slider to change the threshold, we can see the metrics updating below
					it.
				</ui.P>

				<ui.P>
					Once we are happy with a threshold, we can update our prediction code
					to use it. If we omit the threshold, the default value of 0.5 will be
					used.

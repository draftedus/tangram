# Tangram for Node.js

This example shows how to make predictions with your Tangram machine learning model in an app built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

```
$ npm install --save @tangramhq/tangram
```

```javascript
const fs = require('fs')
const tangram = require('@tangramhq/tangram')

const modelData = fs.readFileSync('./heart-disease.tangram')
const model = new tangram.Model(modelData)

const input = {
	age: 63,
	gender: 'male',
	// ...
}

const output = model.predictSync(input)

console.log(output)
```

## Examples

This folder contains two examples, [predict]([predict]) and [monitor](monitor).

### Predict

This example demonstrates loading a model from a `.tangram` file and making a prediction.

### Monitor

This example demonstrates logging predictions and true values to the Tangram reporting and monitoring app. Before running the example, upload the `heart-disease.tangram` file in [monitor/heart-disease.tangram](monitor/heart-disease.tangram) to either https://app.tangramhq.com or your on-prem deployment.

Then you can run the example:

```
$ node monitor/main.js
```

Now if you refresh the production stats or production metrics tabs for the model you uploaded, you should see predictions and true values being reported.

The Tangram Ruby library makes it easy to make predictions with your Tangram machine learning model from Ruby.

## Usage

```
$ gem install tangram
```

```ruby
require 'tangram'

model = Tangram::Model.from_file('./heart-disease.tangram')

input = {
	age: 63,
	gender: 'male',
	# ...
}

output = model.predict(input)

puts(output)
```

## Platform Support

Tangram for Ruby is currently supported for Linux, macOS, and Windows on x86-64/amd64/x64 CPUs. Are you interested in another platform? Get in touch via email at help@tangramhq.com.

## Examples

This folder contains two examples, [examples/predict]([examples/predict]) and [examples/monitor](examples/monitor).

### Basic

This example demonstrates loading a model from a `.tangram` file and making a prediction.

To run the example:

```
$ ruby examples/basic.rb
```

### Advanced

This example demonstrates logging predictions and true values to the Tangram reporting and monitoring app. Before running the example, upload the file `examples/heart-disease.tangram` to either https://app.tangramhq.com or your on-prem deployment.

Then you can run the example:

```
$ ruby examples/monitor/main.rb
```

Now if you refresh the production stats or production metrics tabs for the model you uploaded, you should see predictions and true values being reported.

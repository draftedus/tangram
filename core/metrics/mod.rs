/**
The `Metric` trait defines a common interface to compute metrics such as mean squared error and accuracy, so that generic code can be written that computes arbitrary metrics.

After being initialized, a value of type `T` implementing the `Metric` trait can have `update()` called on it with values of the associated type `Input`. Multiple values of `T` can be merged together by calling `merge()`. This is useful when computing a metric across multiple threads. When finished aggregating, you can call `finalize()` on the metric to produce the associated type `Output`.

# Examples

Here is a basic example implementation of a `Min` metric, which takes `f32`s and produces an `f32` that is the minimum of all the inputs.

```
struct Min(f32);

impl Metric for Min {
  type Input = f32;x
  type Output = f32;
  fn update(&mut self, input: Self::Input) { self.0 = self.0.min(input) };
  fn merge(&mut self, other: Self) { self.0 = self.0.min(other.0) }
  fn finalize(self) -> Self::Output { self.0 }
}
```

The seeminly unused generic lifetime `'a` exists here to allow `Input`s and `Output`s to borrow from their enclosing scope. When Rust stabilizes Generic Associated Types (GATs), the generic lifetime will move to the associated types.

	type Input;
	/// `Output` is the return type of `finalize()`.

	fn update(&mut self, input: Self::Input);
	/// Merge multiple independently computed metrics.
	fn merge(&mut self, other: Self);
	/// When you are done aggregating `Input`s, call `finalize()` to produce an `Output`.

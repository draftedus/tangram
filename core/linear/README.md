# Tangram Linear

Tangram linear contains the code for training and making predictions on linear models.

Linear models consist of a bias and a series of weights, one for each feature.

`y_predict = bias + weights • feature_values`

where weights and feature_values are both vectors of length n and
• is the dot-product.

## Example

Imagine we are trying to predict the price of a house. We have two features, the number of bedrooms, the total square footage and whether or not the house has a garage.

_Features_: `number_of_bedrooms`, `total_square_feet`, `has_garage`.

During training, our model learned the following weights: `[50_000, 30, 22_000]` and bias: `10_000`.

Let's assume we are a real estate agent who wants to use our formula to assess the price of a new home. The home has _4 bedrooms_, _3,200_ square feet and _no garage_. Using our model:

`y_predict = 10_000 + [50_000, 30, 22_000] • [4, 3_200, 0] = 10_000 + 200_000 + 96_000 + 0 = 306_000`.

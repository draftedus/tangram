/*!
This crate is an implementation of machine learning models for regression and classification using ensembles of decision trees. The implementation has many similarities to [LightGBM](github.com/microsoft/lightgbm), [XGBoost](github.com/xgboost/xgboost), and many others, but written in pure Rust.

Through extensive optimization, `tangram_tree` is the fastest such implementation in our benchmarks, while achieving indistinguishable accuracy. All benchmarks are biased, and it is especially difficult to produce apples-to-apples comparisons because the algorithms to train decision trees are so complex and there are so ways to tweak them. However, we have done our best to choose widely accepted example datasets and set as few parameters away from defaults as possible.

## Benchmark results

Here's how to use `tangram_tree` to train a `Regressor`.

```
let mut features = tangram_dataframe::DataFrame::from_path("boston.csv", options, |_| {}).unwrap();
let labels = features.columns.remove(13);
let model = tangram_tree::Regressor::train(features, labels, Default::default(), &mut |_| {});
let features =
let mut predictions: Array1<f32> = Array::zeros(nrows);
model.predict(&features, &mut predictions);
```

There are three model types:

1. [`Regressor`](struct.Regressor.html)
2. [`BinaryClassifier`](struct.BinaryClassifier.html)
3. [`MulticlassClassifier`](struct.MulticlassClassifier.html)

The type of model you are going to train depends on the type of the column you want to predict and in the case of an enum column, the number of unique values.

| Label Type                                      | Number of Enum Options | Model Type                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Number](../dataframe/struct.NumberColumn.html) | *N/A*                  | [`Regressor`](struct.Regressor.html)                       |
| [Enum](../dataframe/struct.EnumColumn.html)     | 2                      | [`BinaryClassifier`](struct.BinaryClassifier.html)         |
| [Enum](../dataframe/struct.EnumColumn.html)     | > 2                    | [`MulticlassClassifier`](struct.MulticlassClassifier.html) |

Under the hood, tangram trees are Gradient Boosted Decision Trees.
